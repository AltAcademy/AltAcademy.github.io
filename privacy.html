Data controller is a legal term used in the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act) to signify the person who controls what to do with any given personal information. <br> <br>

We appreciate that you do not want any personal information you provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect information, what we do with it and what controls you have. This privacy policy may change from time to time so please check back here frequently. <br> <br>

 <u> 1. What personal information do we collect from you? </u> <br> <br> 

1.1 What is personal information?  Personal information is any information that allows someone to identify you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone and mobile numbers, email address, as well as any information about you that is associated with or linked to, or could be linked to, any of the foregoing data. <br> <br>

1.2 Your personal information is collected when you fill in a form on a Website, contact Alt Academy, or complete a form in any of our publications which may relate, for example, to subscriptions, competitions, offers and promotions. The information you give us may include your name, address, email, phone number and payment details. <br> <br>

1.3 Personal information that is provided by you will only be used for the purpose for which it is provided, unless you are informed otherwise at the time of giving the information. <br> <br>

1.4 Alt Academy will from time to time collect information from you for the purpose of creating de-personalised data that does not reveal your identity. Alt Academy uses this information to improve our products and occasionally for other internal purposes.  This information is only used in de-personalised form and is not connected to any name, address or other personal identifying information. <br> <br> <br> 

</div>




 <div id="section2"> <br> <br> <br>

 <u>2. How is your information processed, stored and kept secure?</u> <br> <br>

 2.1 Your personal information may be processed both in and outside the UK.  When you submit your details in whichever country you are situated you agree to the information being processed in the UK. <br> <br>

 2.2 We may also process or transfer your personal information outside the UK (and possibly to places outside the European Economic Area, which is all EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).  Alt Academy shall take reasonable steps to ensure that any transfer of your personal information to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area, whose laws may provide for a lesser standard of protection for your personal information than that provided under European law, shall have adequate protection (such as model contractual arrangements as approved by the EU). <br> <br>

 2.3 The Websites and our servers, wherever they are based, have appropriate technical and organisational measures in place to protect against unauthorised or unlawful use of your personal information as well as the accidental loss, destruction or damage of your personal information whilst under our control. <br> <br>

 2.4 However no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.

  <u>8. How do we use cookies?</u> <br> <br>

  Alt Academy Cookies <br> <br>

  8.1  "Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you.  Cookies are common and won't do anything to harm your system - they simply store or gather information.  They help you to get the most out of your visit to our Websites. <br> <br>

  8.2 We may collect information about your computer including, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type for system administration as part of our audit trail process.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. You are not obliged to accept cookies and you can adjust your browser's setting to prevent it from accepting cookies on your computer - go to www.allaboutcookies.org for instructions on how to disable cookies.  However, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Websites if you do so. <br> <br>

  8.3 Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Although they can be used to store information which may identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify users and passwords and credit card information are not stored in cookies. <br> <br>

  8.4 Our Websites use two main types of cookies: <br> <br>

  Per-session cookies.  We only use these whilst you are visiting our website and they are deleted when you leave.  They remember you as you move between pages, for example recording the items you add to an online shopping basket.  They also help maintain security. <br> <br>

  Persistent cookies.  These cookies stay on your computer until they expire or are deleted.  We set automatic deletion dates so that we don't keep your information for longer than we need to. <br> <br>
 

  8.5 Our Websites also use cookies, for example, to: <br> <br>

  <li>Gather customer journey information across our sites and fulfil any of your requests;</li>
  <li>Ensure your privacy when you visit our secure sites;</li>
  <li>Store login details for our secure sites;</li>
  <li>Store details of your marketing preferences to improve and enhance your visit to our sites;</li>
  <li>Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness - all information is anonymised and we don't share it with anyone;</li>
  <li>Remember settings you have applied to a Website such as layout, font size, preferences, colours etc;</li>
  <li>Detect if a service has already been offered to you so that we don't ask you again.</li>
